siaynoq :: the typical geek's anti-shell for Windows


  It isn't skinnable, themeable, configurable or <insert favorite fancy
  adjective here>.

  It doesn't try to catch your eye or invite you to fiddle with it; in
  fact, it tries hard not to be noticed.

  It doesn't try to change the way you interact with your computer into
  a radically enchanting and fundamentally life-altering one.  It just
  tries to help you get your work done.

  In other words, it doesn't try to do more than is absolutely
  necessary.  If other tools can be found to take care of a particular
  job, pass the buck.


:: projects I stole from

 Heavily influenced by larswm[1], which introduced me to the idea of a
 tiling window manager and from which I borrowed a lot of ideas.

 Several things where also borrowed from dwm[2]: mainly, the idea that
 an explicit list of window classes/instances to tile can be done away
 with.

 I learned how to fiddle with Windows hooks through TraySaver[3] and
 LiteShell's source code.  The latter, incidentally, was my proof that a
 shell need not be bloated to be useful.
